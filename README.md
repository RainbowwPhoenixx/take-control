# Take Control: a Control TAS tool

## Builing & running the tool

Building the tool should be as simple as:
- Installing rust using rustup (https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
- Running `cargo build` at the root of the directory

To run the tool, you can then use `cargo run` or run it manually (the executable should be located in `target/debug/injector.exe`) while the game is running.
